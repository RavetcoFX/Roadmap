	Clock says 15:38. Go to time settings. Turn off network time. Turn it back on. Wait for 10 seconds or so.. time updates to correct time and says 16:38. (either Cinnamon loses track of ntp when disconnected/reconnected to network, or it fails to use it at login time)

Feedback from Corbin
--------------------
    *Changing Wallpaper somtimes freezes cinnamon (Needs reproducing)
    *Copying large files (< 200mb), nemo reports 99% the whole time.
    *Rename file/folder field can be hard to read in some cases, eg. the desktop
    *[Fixed] In Spices the "Updates Available!" button is visually glitchy
    *Installing Nvidia drivers makes tty and boot screen low resolution (http://www.conanblog.me/it/how-to-get-the-high-resolution-for-tty-back-after-nvidia-driver-update-in-ubuntu/)    
    *Brasero Wont open after burning a disk
    
    Moving applets in cinnamon panel edit mode on, glitches out systray icons when it is shifted
    Cinnamon Settings start in advanced mode on fresh install even if not in admin mode
    Cannot Middle click most toolbar items in Nemo
    User Applet user picture and name is visually offset in MintX Cinnamon theme
    Calender Applet should link to "cinnamon-settings calendar"(?)
    When a maximized window is minimized, and you activate the hot corner or expo, it makes a split second glitch view of that window (Tested with banshee)
    The mint logo on the menu is a bitmap(png) and is blurry when the panel is resized, it should be svg
    Mounted disks shouldent show by default one the desktop(?)
    In Applets/Desklet config, the more actions button icon makes no sense, should be cog icon (?)
    Volume change sound is terribly high pitched, it should be the bubble sound (?)
    LibreOffice Loading bar is orange, should be mint green (?)
    Changing default applications does nothing
    gnome-disk-utility 3.8.2 is fugly and unintutive

De-scoped
---------		
	Cinnamon: Launching keepass + xsel freezes Cinnamon [wrouesnel] (unknown cause/solution)	
	GTK3: dialogs use symbolic icons (offending code is in GTK3, won't fix. Small issue but linked to GTK3 becoming a GNOME Shell specific toolkit.)
	GTK3: No padding in context menu leads to accidental operations (bug reported upstream in GTK3, temp workaround/fix unlikely/tedious)
	GNOME: gnome-calculator menubar (minor cosmestic issue, won't fix)
	System: gksu covers cinnamon panel and clutter layer (offending code is in libgksu, won't fix, likely to migrate to pkexec instead)
	System: Support for Wacom tablet (configurable via the command line, will need to join forces with Xfce/MATE if we want to develop a cross DE UI. This doesn't justify pulling resources to make a Cinnamon specific solution)	
	System: EFI booth path isn't standard (EFI installation in Virtualbox works fine, but upon reboot it loses its NVRAM and isn't able to find the EFI boot files)
	MDM: l10n doesn't cover new features (MDM 1.4 is still using the l10n it inherited from GDM. Decision was taken to migrate MDM entirely to Mint/LP translations in 1.6, not just mdmwebkit/mdmsetup).
	MP3 online doesn't work (known limitation with totem)
